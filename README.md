Ant Colony Optimization for TSP

This project facilitates experimental testing of the
ant colony optimization (ACO) problem for approximating
solutions to the travelling salesperson problem (TSP).

The "Test" file has a main method for specifying the
problem and different parameters.

The ACO problem executes a single Ant Colony System optimization
for a given TSP with given parameters.

The EAS problem executes a single Elitist Ant System
problem for a given TSP with given parameters.

The Edge class represents an edge between two cities.

The City class represents a city by geographic coordinates.

The TSP class reads in a file and translates it into
cities and edges.
